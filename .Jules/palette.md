## 2024-05-23 - Accessible Terminal Controls
**Learning:** Icon-only buttons (like traffic lights) often get skipped by screen reader users if they lack labels. Adding `aria-label` is critical. Also, utilizing `group` and `group-hover` in Tailwind is a great way to add "invisible" affordances like hover icons without cluttering the UI.
**Action:** Always check "decorative" UI elements (like Mac window controls) for accessibility and add hidden labels or hover states.
